- Codex: https://commondoc.github.io/codex/docs/tutorial.html

Problems:
- some  entries don't  have docstrings  and  throw an  error. I  added
  "missing entry" on slime's debugger.
- for a lot of functions codex displays "No node with name â€¦".

Get a list of all =defS=:

: cat s-code.lisp | grep -o "(defS .*" | cut -d ' ' -f2

: (m-buffer-match-string-no-properties (m-buffer-match (current-buffer) "^\(defS .*"))
